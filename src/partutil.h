 *
 * If geometry_hps and geomtry_spt are both positive, they will be
 * used as the geometry of the disk for CHS<->LBA conversions. Notably
 * this is only applicable for MSDOS / MSDOS_EXTENDED partition
 * tables. Also, in this case, geometry is enforced to ensure that
 * partitions start and end at cylinder boundaries.
 * 
 * If either geometry_hps or geomtry_spt are zero, geometry is
 * simply ignored and partitions will only be aligned to blocks, e.g.
 * normally 512 byte boundaries.
 *
 * If both geometry_hps or geomtry_spt are -1, then geometry information
 * probed from existing partition table entries / file systems on the
 * disk. This is not always reliable.
 *
 * As such, the caller cannot always expect that the partition created
 * will be at the requested offset and size due to e.g. geometry and
 * block boundary alignment. Therefore, the start and size where the
 * partition ends up is passed in the out_start and out_size
 * arguments.
 *
 * As embedded partition tables are supported, the caller should use
 * part_table_find() in advance to make sure that the passed type,
 * label and flags match the (embedded) partition table that this
 * partition will be part of.
 *
 * To create an MSDOS extended partition table in a MSDOS partition
 * table, simply pass 0x05, 0x0f or 0x85 as the partition type.
 *
 * In order for changes to take effect, the caller needs to poke the
 * OS kernel himself to make it reload the partition table. It is not
 * automatically done by this function.

 * obtained with part_table_load_from_disk() since the in-memory data structure
 * is not updated.
