For 2.20:
	* Finish formatting backend
		- Just format a partition
		- Rewrite table and format

	* Write scripts to handle various filesystems

	* Fix GTK errors and clean up filesystem type dialog

	* Fix HAL problems regarding automatically updating device dialog

	* Permissions? Either gksu or punt on this one and let distros handle
	  it.

	* Write floppy formatting support, most likely code taken directly from
	  GFloppy
	
Future:
	* Add support for other file system types, when they are available

	* Use HAL to do formatting instead of spawning out processes - this is
	  the real way to solve permissions issues but until HAL decides to do
	  this we can't do much other than harass them
